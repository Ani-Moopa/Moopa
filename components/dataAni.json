      "description": "The elite members of Shuchiin Academy's student council continue their competitive day-to-day antics. Council president Miyuki Shirogane clashes daily against vice-president Kaguya Shinomiya, each fighting tooth and nail to trick the other into confessing their romantic love.

Miko Iino, the newest student council member, grows closer to the rule-breaking Ishigami while striving to overcome her own authoritarian moral code.<br>\n<br>\nAs love further blooms at Shuchiin Academy, the student council officers drag their outsider friends into increasingly comedic conflicts.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The first episode had an advanced screening on April 2, in both New York & Los Angeles.<br>",

After a long battle in love, these two geniuses communicated their feelings and, at the Hoshin Festival, had their very first kiss. However, there was no clear confession of love. The relationship between these two, who assumed they would be a couple, remains ambiguous. Now, overly conscious of their feelings, they must face the biggest challenge yet: Christmas. It’s Shirogane who wants it to be perfect versus Kaguya who pursues the imperfect situation. This is the very “normal” love story of two geniuses and the first kiss that never ends.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Aniplex of America)\n<br><br>\n<em>Kaguya-sama: Love is War -The First Kiss That Never Ends- first premiered in theaters across Japan on December 17, 2022.
